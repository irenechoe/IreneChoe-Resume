        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Majorüß†</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I‚Äôm Irene Choe. I graduated from South Torrance High School in 2022 and I‚Äôm currently a first-year pursuing a B.A. in Psychology at the University of California, Riverside. I‚Äôve found a keen interest in coding after taking my first computer science course during the Fall Quarter. While studying Psychology, I hope to learn more coding languages and add a Computer Science minor in the meantime. I‚Äôm looking forward to learning more about both Computer Science and Psychology throughout my 4-year journey here at UCR.<br><br>

        Before I got admitted to Riverside, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was capable enough take a Comp Sci course at my highschool. And because I thought I wasn‚Äôt much of a ‚Äútech person.‚Äù I always underestimated myself and thought I didn't have potential to pursue a STEM major. But after taking these introductory courses in college, I started understanding what my passions are and what I actually enjoy doing or would enjoy doing for a living. Like my parents told me, it‚Äôs okay to take classes outside your major. If that course intrigues you the most, it‚Äôs a sign you found something you can pursue as your future career. And since then, I‚Äôve kept post-its and notes with encouraging words to guide myself.<br><br>

        Most of my experiences have come from group work and projects. Throughout highschool, I‚Äôve participated in multiple clubs, many that focused on cultural diversity and socializing. One of which was the Korean club, which focused on welcoming those who are also interested in the culture of Korea. Despite the pandemic being a burden, I was involved in multiple events, some that were about performing at different high schools. By joining the club, it also allowed me to form close connections with individuals who have also been in the same shoes as me and gave me advice for my future.<br></br>
        
        I was also an active member in a student organization called Students of Warmth. This organization focused on making clothes, resources, and providing service to shelters for homeless people. From something I initially thought of it as extra spots to fill in my college application, I have quickly become more committed. Soon enough, I suggested this organization to my friends, some who have joined the club at the same time as me. Thus, I‚Äôve received presidential awards and a lot of sincerity from others from my 4-years participating in the organization.<br></br>
        
        Although most of my experiences were more on cultural and social aspects of psychology, such as social interactions and community service, I haven‚Äôt signed up for internships yet. With my current experience, I hope to sign up for internships and programs, and possibly boot camps for computer science and further my knowledge about Psychology to land a job into Information Technology or software engineering.<br></br>
